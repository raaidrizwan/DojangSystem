IMPORTANT - DO NOT PLAGIARIZE FOR SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS. THIS IS FOR SHOWCASE USE ONLY. A basic program I created in my senior year of high school in order to store and manage the personal/academic information of a Taekwondo dojang's students. This was my first major escapade into the realm of computer science, other than coding tournaments and classes.
