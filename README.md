# DojangSystem
IMPORTANT - DO NOT PLAGIARIZE FOR SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS. THIS IS FOR SHOWCASE USE ONLY. 

A basic Java program I created in my senior year of high school in order to store and manage the personal/academic information of a Taekwondo dojang's students. This was my first major escapade into the realm of computer science, other than coding tournaments and classes.

This demonstrates my initial AP CS A (IB CS SL) level of Java and programming fundamentals, including object-oriented programming and data structures such as arrays and ArrayLists. It also includes a rudimentary data file I/O system and a basic UI using JOptionPane elements.

As a limited-scope school program, there are a variety of issues and shortcomings which I may or may not fix for my own entertainment later, including:

- UI elements may be exceeded if the data structures hold too many elements.
- Data file I/O only saves limited information.
- Redundant methods created over the course of the development of the program due to elementary planning.
- A variety of methods and classes have limited or no comments, due to sudden revisions necessary for the school grade.
